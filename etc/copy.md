Should we describe or hint at where we came up with Faraday Day what it means (kind of like RESA- LOGOM if that helps)
Be a little more creative on the text, things to do, more related to our location? Hype up our close proximity to everything?
 I just feel that with our interior design thoughts and push for new spaces that the copy should be a little more interesting.


Welcome to Faraday Park, where life is about the intimate, blissful moments that make each day wonderful.

This is the place to make every day a Faraday Day, full of appreciation for life's magic...

the feeling the sunlight stream through your windows, savoring the first sip of your morning coffee, or lying down in the grass with a good book.

In our thoughtfully-designed spaces you'll be surrounded by the colors and textures of calm.

Effortless access to the Wiehle-Reston Metro Station, Reston Town Center, and Dulles Toll Road make Faraday Park the perfect home base for everything you do.

Exquisite dining, vibrant shopping, and soulful entertainment are all just minutes away.

At Faraday Park, we wish you a life fully lived.
